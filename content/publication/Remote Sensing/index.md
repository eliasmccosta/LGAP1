abstract: >
  Soil texture has a great influence on the physical–hydric and chemical behavior of soils. In the Amazon regions, due to the presence of dense forest cover and limited access to roads, carrying out surveys and mapping of soils is challenging. When data exist, they are relatively sparse and the distribution is quite uneven. In this context, machine learning algorithms (ML) associated with remote sensor covariates offer a framework to derive digital maps of soil attributes. The objective of this study was to produce maps of surface and subsurface soil clay, silt, and sand contents in a 13,440 km² area in the Amazon. The specific objectives were to: (a) evaluate the gain in prediction accuracy when using the P-band of airborne radar as a covariate; (b) evaluate two sampling approaches (Reference Area—RA and Total Area—TA); and (c) evaluate the transferability and performance of three ML algorithms: regression tree (RT), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). The study site was divided into three blocks, called Urucu, Araracanga, and Juruá, respectively. The soil dataset consisted of 151 surface and subsurface sand, silt, and clay observations and 21 covariates (20 relief variables and the backscattering coefficient from the P-band). Despite the low observation density, inherently hindered by the low accessibility of the area and high costs of sampling thereof, the results showed the potential of ML algorithms boosted by airborne radar P-band to map soil clay, silt, and sand contents in the Amazon.
