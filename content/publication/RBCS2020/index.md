abstract: >
  DSM tools are useful for soil sampling and mapping in areas with limited access.
  Non-linear models are more effective to map soil properties than linear models.
  GAM_scorpan model can improve soil properties predictions.
  GAM smooth functions can successfully map soil properties in 3-D.
  The high functionality of 2-D and 3-D maps benefits decision-makers.

  We are grateful to INP administrators for providing access and support to data collection
  as well as the cartographic base, and the training and laboratory funding from Graduate
  Course in Agronomy – Soil Science, UFRRJ, Brazil. Thanks to The James Hutton Institute,
  Aberdeen, Scotland, for providing physical structure and specialized knowledge that
  aided the research, particularly the supervision of Dr. Laura Poggio. The work was
  supported by scholarships from the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovations and
  Communications through CNPq (Process 141391/2015-4), the Ministry of Education
  through CAPES Foundation (Process 88881.135776/2016-01), and grants from FAPERJ
  Foundation (Process E_34/2014).
