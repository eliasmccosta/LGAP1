abstract: >
  The soil organic matter (SOM) content and dynamic are related to vegetation cover, climate, relief, and geology; these factors have strong variation in space in the southeastern of Brazil. The objective of the study was to compare and evaluate performance of classical multiple linear regressions (MLR) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) and chemical fractions of organic matter in the Brazilian southeastern mountainous region. The regression models were fitted based on SOC and chemical fractions of SOM. The points (n = 89) were selected by pedologist's experience along transects and toposequences. The covariates were also selected using the empirical knowledge of pedologists when choosing variables that drive soil.

summary: >
  The study was developed by Elias Mendes Costa, Wagner de Souza Tassinari, Helena Saraiva Koenow Pinheiro, Sidinei Julio Beutler, and Lúcia Helena Cunha dos Anjos as part of the Master Thesis of Elias Mendes Costa presented before the technical course in statistics at Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro on July 2017.
